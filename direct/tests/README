NB THis directory uses a hacked version of fsx.c which is released under
Apple Public Source License.

From what I have been able to determine, it is legally OK to release a hacked
version for the purposes of testing.

I find it best to run these tests in a ramfs to make them run faster (and
not pound the disk).

A quick word about running some of these tests...


There are two tests, one simulating nor and the other nand, labelled

*nor*.sh and *nand*.sh

These can be run in the local directory as follows:
$ ./init_fw_update_test_nand.sh
$ ./run_fw_update_test_nand.sh

NB These create simulation files in the current directory, so only one
instance can be run in a directory.

The number of iterations can be set by adding a numerical parameter

$ ./init_fw_update_test_nand.sh
$ ./run_fw_update_test_nand.sh 5000

Since the test creates snapshot files between each iteration the test is
relatively slow if run against a hard disk. Far better to run against a ram
disk

$ mkdir xxx
$ mount -t tmpfs none xxx
$ cd xxx
$ cp ../*sh .
$ ln -s ../yaffs_test yaffs_test
$ ./init_fw_update_test_nand.sh
$ ./run_fw_update_test_nand.sh

The above is also wrapped in a script called manage_nor_test.sh which
creates all the above. The managed_nor_test.sh script accepts an optional
parameter to specify an instance name. Named instances will create named
directories.

If you want to run multuiple instances then it is easy to do so with 
xterm as follows:

$ xterm  -e "`pwd`/manage_nor_test.sh  1"&
$ xterm  -e "`pwd`/manage_nor_test.sh  2"&
$ xterm  -e "`pwd`/manage_nor_test.sh  3"&
...

Then there's launch_tests.sh which sets up a tmpfs directory and launches 3
nor simulations and 3 nand simulations.
