Current BUGS 
	Bug with opening a file with a name of 1,000,000 char long with no errors.

	Bug with unlinking a file with 1,000,000 get the error ENOENT but should
	be geting ENAMETOOLONG. 

	Bug with mounting a too long non-existant mount point is returning 
	ENODEV. there are two errors here, ENOENT and ENAMETOOLONG.
	The ENODEV is the error which yaffs gives instead of ENOENT.
	BBut the mount function should just return ENAMETOOLONG.

	Bug when mounting a non-existing mount point. The error code returned is 
	ENODEV.

	Bug when trying to use yaffs_access on an existing file with mode 255 
	the error returned is EACCES it should be EINVAL(note there is no quick test file yet).

	Bug when trying to access a non-existing directory the error ENOENT is 
	returned. It should be ENOTDIR.

	Bug when trying to truncate a file in a non-existing directory. The error
	returned is ENOENT it should be ENOTDIR.

	Bug truncating a file to a size of -1 does not cause an error. 

	BUG truncating a file to a size greater than the maximum file size should 
	return the error EFBIG. However EFBIG has not been defined in yaffs and 
	needs to be added. When a file is truncated to a large size 
	(size =10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) the truncate 
	function works without any errors, which is wrong. 

	Bug with opening a file with bad mode. yaffs_open has two modes which 
	are passed into it. if the modes are set to 255 the open function 
	does not report any errors. (Also need to try this with modes set to -1.)  


Current WARNINGS
	WARNING- If yaffs is unmounted then most of yaffs' functions return ENODIR. 
	some function return EBADF instead.

	WARNING- When mounting a non-existing mount point the error ENODEV is returned.
	The quick tests have been altered to accommodate this error code.    
	With standard access function in linux the error returned is ENOENT.
