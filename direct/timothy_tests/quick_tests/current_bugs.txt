Current BUGS 

	NAME SIZE
		Bug with opening a file with a name of 1,000,000 char long with no errors.
		The open function should be returning ENAMETOOLONG.

		Bug with unlinking a file with 1,000,000 get the error ENOENT but should
		be geting ENAMETOOLONG. 

		Bug with mounting a too long non-existant mount point is returning 
		ENODEV. yaffs_mount should be returning ENAMETOOLONG.
		When the name is passed into the yaffs_mount function the length of the
		mount point decreases from around 10000000 to 200. This needs to be investigated.
		
		Bug with unmounting a too long non-existing mountpoint. 
		The error returned is ENODEV. It should be ENAMETOOLONG.


	ENOTDIR ERRORS
		Bug when trying to access a non-existing directory the error ENOENT is 
		returned. It should be ENOTDIR.

		Bug when trying to truncate a file in a non-existing directory. The error
		returned is ENOENT it should be ENOTDIR.

	Bug with truncating to a very large size. The yaffs_truncate function truncates the file to a massive size without any errors.
	The function should return the error EINVAL. 

	Bug with lseeking to a very large size (size =100000000000000000000000000000000000000) without causing an error.
	Should cause the error EINVAL.

	Bug with unmounting a non-existing mountpoint. The function returns ENODEV 
	but should be returning EINVAL.
	
	Bug with reading -1 bytes of a file without an error (test is in test_yaffs_read_EINVAL).
	It should return EINVAL.

	Unmount2 forcing the unmount needs to break the handles so they return EBADF.


Current WARNINGS
	
	WARNING- If yaffs is unmounted then most of yaffs' functions return ENODIR. 
	But some function return EBADF instead.
	Functions which return ENOTDIR: open, close, access, unlink, lseek, write, read

	Functions which return ENOENT: access, stat
	


	WARNING-the function yaffs_open does not check the mode passed to it. 
	This means that yaffs open does not return EINVAL if a bad mode is passed to it.
	However this causes the error EEXIST to happen instead, because both O_CREAT and O_EXCL  flags are set.

	WARNING- yaffs_open will work with either of the two mode set to 255.
	However there are only 4 or 5 flags that can be set for each of the modes.
	This means that the programmer may not be setting the flags properly.  

	WARNING- When mounting a non-existing mount point the error ENODEV is returned.
	The quick tests have been altered to accommodate this error code.    
	With standard access function in linux the error returned is ENOENT.
