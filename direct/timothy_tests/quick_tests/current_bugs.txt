Current BUGS 


Current WARNINGS
	
	WARNING- If yaffs is unmounted then most of yaffs' functions return ENODIR. 
	But some function return EBADF instead.
	Functions which return ENOTDIR: open, close, access, unlink, lseek, write, read

	Functions which return ENOENT: access, stat
	


	WARNING-the function yaffs_open does not check the mode passed to it. 
	This means that yaffs open does not return EINVAL if a bad mode is passed to it.
	However this causes the error EEXIST to happen instead, because both O_CREAT and O_EXCL  flags are set.

	WARNING- yaffs_open will work with either of the two mode set to 255.
	However there are only 4 or 5 flags that can be set for each of the modes.
	This means that the programmer may not be setting the flags properly.  

	WARNING- When mounting a non-existing mount point the error ENODEV is returned.
	The quick tests have been altered to accommodate this error code.    
	With standard access function in linux the error returned is ENOENT.
