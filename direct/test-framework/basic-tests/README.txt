basic-tests README

This test is where we write a tests to 
reproduce errors that are hard to recreate.

These errors frequently require yaffs to be put 
into abnormal states, which will not work well in 
normal test rig.

The solutions are manually verified here.

This is not designed to be run by you as a test rig.
It is just here for us to use for debugging purposes.
